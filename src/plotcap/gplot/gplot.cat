DESCRIPTION
     ,The +gplot ,routines allow plotting to any device definable
     within the plot device description data base _p_l_o_t_c_a_p.  The
     routines allow some very simple graphics primitives to be
     implemented on any of these devices.  It should be noted
     that not all desired graphics operations can be performed,
     only a simple subset is available - there is no cursor
     tracking, for example.  However, there are functions for
     transformations, clipping, area fill and cursor locating.
     This document is a simple introduction to the +gplot ,library.
     For the full description, see +gplot2,(3L).

     In general, you will want to first select the plot device
     for output using +setpdev(,_p_l_o_t_d_e_v+) ,where _p_l_o_t_d_e_v is a null
     terminated character string giving the name of the plot dev-
     ice as specified in the +plotcap ,file.

     Next, create the desired plot with the routines to move,
     draw, clear and transform. And, finally, post all internal
     buffers and end plotting to the given device with a call to
     +gpend(),.  If no call is made to +setpdev(),, the +gplot
     ,software will try to set up a default plot device.  It first
     looks for an environment variable +DEFPDEV,.  If found, the
     +plotcap ,file is searched for the device given as the value
     of +DEFPDEV . ,If no such environment variable is given, the
     environment is then searched for the variable +TERM,.
     Finally, if if neither variable is set, the +plotcap ,file is
     searched for a device called _d_e_f_a_u_l_t.  This device is gen-
     erally defined at the beginning of the +plotcap ,file for the
     local system's default plotdevice.  For example:

          +default: LIKE="hp2648"::  # our default plot dev

     ,To override the default output device, call
     +setpfil(,_p_l_o_t_f_i_l_e+) ,where _p_l_o_t_f_i_l_e is the name of the new out-
     put file. Note that if both +setpdev,() and +setpfil,() are
     being used, the file should be set first.  This is because
     the +setpdev,() function prepares for plotting by opening the
     default file if one isn't set.

     Units used in calls are in default plot units for the device
     (e.g. inches).  These units can be scaled with calls to
     gscale().

+FUNCTIONS
     setpdev,(plotdev)
          Optional call to select the output plotting device.  If
          the device is not found in a plotcap file, an error is
          printed and -1 is returned, else 0 is returned.  The
          system plotcap file is searched (often:
          /usr/local/lib/plotcap), however, if the environment
          variable PLOTCAP is set, that will be used as the
          plotcap file.  If no call to +setpdev ,is made, then the
          environment variable DEFPDEV is searched for. If this
          is not set, then the environment variable TERM is used.
          If this is not set, the device "default" will be used.
          In all cases, a failure in setting a device will result
          in all subsequent plotting calls going to a null device
          (until a new, good device gets set).

     +setpfil,(plotfil)
          Optional call to select the output plot file.  If the
          environment variable DEFPFIL is set it will be used as
          the default if there is never any call to +setpfil,.  If
          this is not set, then the FILE capability in the
          plotcap file will be used.  If there is no file capa-
          bility, then the standard output is used.  If the file
          name is simply a dot (`.') the the standard output will
          be used as the output file (useful for overriding the

          default file).  If the file name begins with a plus
          (`+') the the output file will be opened in append
          mode.  If the file name begins with a pipe-symbol (`|')
          then the remainder of the filename string is taken as a
          command line to be executed into which the plot library
          will pipe its output (say a spooler or a filter).
          Return -1 if error or 0 if ok.

     +setsfil,(filename)
          Open the file as an _a_u_t_o-_s_a_v_e _f_i_l_e.  No matter what
          device has been set (with setpdev()) and what output
          file (with setpfil()) each plot call will also be saved
          in the named file in the gplot-binary-meta-file format.
          These files can be replayed with +dplot,(1L), for exam-
          ple.  Return -1 if error or 0 if ok.

     +gplot,(x,y,pen)
          According to _p_e_n, move (pen = _G__M_O_V_E) or draw (pen =
          _G__D_R_A_W) to the given (x,y) point.

     +gmove,(x,y)
          Move to the given (x,y) point with the pen up. Same as
          +gplot(x,y,G_MOVE) ,.

     +gdraw,(x,y)
          Draw to the given (x,y) point with the pen down.  Same
          as +gplot(x,y,G_DRAW),.

     +gclear,()
          Clear the screen / go to the next page / prepare for
          the next plot.

     +ggtoa,()
          Post internal buffers to the plot output file and
          switch to alpha-mode if need be.  This is useful when
          the output device is a terminal to see intermediate
          plots.  This should always be used before prompting
          (for example).  The function +post,() is a synonym; it
          remains for historical reasons.  There is also a func-
          tion +gatog,() which can be used to switch back to graph-
          ics mode before continuing to plot.  It is not needed,
          however, since the plot library is aware that ggtoa()
          was called and will automatically switch back to graph-
          ics mode when needed.

     +gpend,()
          The mandatory last plotting function.  Posts all inter-
          nal buffers, executes any clean up functions (ie: put-
          ting the terminal back in alpha mode) and ends plotting
          to the current device.

          Define and fill a polygonal area (with the current area
          fill pattern/color).  For the first point the the area,
          _h_o_w should be +G_BEGIN,. For each subsequent point, _h_o_w
          should be +G_ON,. And finally, any other command (other
          than +garea(x,y,G_ON) ,will cause the current area to be
          filled.  It is however a good idea to have a final call
          with _h_o_w +G_OFF ,or +G_STOP,.  If the last point given does
          not close the polygon, gplot will close it.

     +gnfill,(n)
          Select the a new area fill pattern to be used for sub-
          sequent calls to area fill.  The number of possible
          patterns is device dependent, but is alway greater that
          zero.  The actual number can be obtained with the
          gpgeti(G_FILS,iv,fv) call - iv[0] is the current type
          and iv[1] is the maximum number available.

     +gnline,(n)
          Select the new line pattern to be used for subsequent
          drawing.  The number of possible patterns is device
          dependent, but is alway greater that zero.  The actual
          number can be obtained with the gpgeti(G_LINE,iv,fv)
          call - iv[0] is the current type and iv[1] is the max-
          imum number available.

     +gnpen,(n)
          Select the new pen style to be used for subsequent
          drawing.  The number of possible styles is device
          dependent, but is alway greater that zero.  The actual
          number can be obtained with the gpgeti(G_PEN,iv,fv)
          call - iv[0] is the current style and iv[1] is the max-
          imum number available.

     +gscale,(x,y)
          Scale all following plotting by the values given for
          each direction.  To ``undo'' a given scaling, use:
          +gscale(1.0/x,1.0/y),.

     +gtrans,(x,y)
          Offset (translate) all following plotting by the values
          given for each direction.  To undo a given translation,
          use: +gtrans(-x,-y),.

     +grotat,(x,y,angle)
          Rotate all following plotting about point (x,y) through
          the given angle (in degrees).  To undo a given rota-
          tion, use: +grotat,(x,y, -angle).

     +gclipl,(x,y,how)
          Set the lower bound clipping limits.  If how is G_ONLOG
          (the default if how is 0) then X and Y are taken to be
          logical values. If how is G_ONPHS then the X and Y

          values are not transformed, assuming that they are phy-
          sical locations (in the original plot units).  It is
          also possible to set whether, on return to the visible
          screen, a clipped line is broken from or connected to
          the point at which it left.  This is done by calling
          either gclipl() or gcliph() as: gclipl(0.,0.,G_DOBREAK)
          - to not connect the two clipped points or
          gclipl(0.,0.,G_NOBREAK) - to connect (not break) the
          two clipped points.  Clip values can be reset with
          greset(G_CLIPL).

     +gcliph(x,y,how)
          ,Like gclipl(x,y,how), but set the higher clip limits.
          Clip values can be reset with greset(G_CLIPH).

     +gpgeti,(cmd,+iv,,fv)
          Get information.  This can be used to get the current
          cursor location or to return internal parameters. Fol-
          lowing are the descriptions for each _c_m_d.

          G_CLOC
               Let the user move the cursor and select a loca-
               tion. Return the cursor location as: fv[0] - x
               location, fv[1] - y location, iv[2] - is the
               key/button used to select the location.

          G_PSIZE
               Return the maximum size of the current device.
               fv[0] - maximum X size, fv[1] - maximum Y size.

          G_CLIPL
               Return the current lower bounds clipping loca-
               tions.

          G_CLIPH
               Return the current upper bounds clipping loca-
               tions.

          G_REVCO
               Return the current revision code (version number)
               of the gplot library in iv[0].

          G_LINE
               Return the current line type (iv[0]) and the max-
               imum number of lines supported by the current dev-
               ice (iv[1]).

          G_PEN
               Return the current pen type (iv[0]) and the max-
               imum number of pens supported by the current dev-
               ice (iv[1]).
