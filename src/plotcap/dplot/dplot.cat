NAME
     dplot - General data plotting / plot manipulation program.

SYNOPSIS
     dplot [-l[2]]  [-o  outfile]  [-d  plotdev]  [-t  tplotfile]
     [data/command files] [-i]

VERSION 4.1b
     mail bugs to dplot-bugs@Oasis.Stanford.Edu or
     {ucbvax,decwrl}!labrea!oasis!dplot-bugs

CHANGES SINCE REV. 3.3
     Rev 4.1a Labels can now be place relative  to  data  coordi-
     nates      using      the      $label.loc.data     (default:
     $label.loc.screen).  Subsequent $label.loc N calls  will  be
     take  as  data  values.   Also, $locate commands will return
     values relative to the data values.
     Added the $pen.symb command to control the pen thickness for
     drawing  symbols similar to the $pen.data and $pen.axis com-
     mands.
     Added the $label.size N command to set the  size  of  labels
     ($label,   $symb.label,   $line.label)  independent  of  the
     $symb.size command.  Formerly, $label.size  =  $symb.size  *
     1.5

     Rev 3.4 There is a  command  to  call  the  high2  library's
     axplt2() function directly from dplot.  It is not pretty nor
     easy to use (since it is simply a raw interface to  axplt2()
     itself), but in some cases it may be the only way to get the
     job done.  The comnand is $axplt2 _s_t_r_i_n_g.  The argument is a
     comma  separated  list  of parameters for axplt2().  See the
     high2 manual for details.

     Rev 3.3 Add the ``$echo string'' command.  Helpful for  com-
     menting script files.

DESCRIPTION
     dplot is a general plotting program that takes several  dif-
     ferent  inputs  and  creates  plots  on a given plot device.
     There are two main and overlapping uses for dplot:  plotting
     raw  data  and   redrawing  plot  ``save'' files. dplot also
     allows transformation of plots through offsetting, rotation,
     and  scaling.   It  can  also produce plots for several dif-
     ferent plot devices.

     Command line arguments can be actual dplot commands or  some
     special  commands  used only on the command line.  Arguments
     include:

     -d plotdev
          Set plot device to 'plotdev'.  If used, this should  be
          the  first argument to dplot.  The device specification

          can be any device defined in the plot device  capabili-
          ties  data  base  _p_l_o_t_c_a_p.  If no plot device is given,
          the value of the environment variable DEFPDEV  will  be
          used.   If  this  is  not given, the user's terminal is
          taken as the plot device to use.

     -t tplotfile
          Take _t_p_l_o_t_f_i_l_e as a binary save file  (like  that  pro-
          duced by Suprem-III or dplot with the output device set
          to save).  Redraw the  plot  with  any  transformations
          already given to dplot.

     files...
          The named file are take to be data/dplot-command files.
          Both  data  and dplot commands can be intermixed within
          the same file or any number of files.  A standard setup
          can be placed in one file followed by the data files or
          everything in one file.

     -f file
          Like above, but just the single file name following  is
          taken  as a dplot commands/text file.  Useful after the
          -T option has been used to insert a commands/text file.

     -T   Take all subsequent (untagged) files to be tplot files.
          This  switches  the  default  from untagged files being
          text/commands and -t tagged files are tplot files.

     -F   Take all subsequent (untagged) files to be  dplot  com-
          mand/ text files.  This undoes the -T option.

     -o outfile
          Set plot output file to _o_u_t_f_i_l_e.  All output  will  put
          in  this  file  instead  of the default device given in
          plotcap.  This option works best if it is given  before
          the -d (device) option.

     -l[2]
          Log all dplot commands to the file dplot.log.  This  is
          an  ascii  file  of  dplot  commands that can be edited
          and/or re-executed by dplot.  If  the  option  is  -l2,
          then save files will be expanded and logged.

     -i   Use the standard input as the  input  file  for  dplot.
          This  option  can  be  inserted anywhere in the command
          line and as often as necessary.  This can be used,  for
          example,  to  pipe program output into dplot after some
          setup files have been read. _N_O_T_E: If no  arguments  are
          given  on  the  command  line,  the  standard  input is
          assumed.

     -    Same as -i.  More Unix compatible concept.

     ,    Same as -i.  Easier for me to use.

     -{dplot command} [dplot arg]
          Any dplot command and possible argument can be given on
          the command line beginning with a '-' (minus sign).

     Several examples may help illustrate what can be  done  with
     dplot.

     % dplot -clear setup file.dat
          Will clear the screen,  take  commands  from  the  file
          setup and read the data from file.dat

     % dplot -d hp2623 -clear setup file.dat
          Like above, but plots to the hp2623 terminal.

     % dplot
          Use the standard input as input for dplot

     % dplot -d hp2623 setup -i
          Use new plot device, take commands from the setup  file
          and  continue reading from the standard input (until an
          EOF).

     % dplot setup fil1.dat fil2.dat fil3.dat

     Set up for given data ranges, etc and plot data from several
     data files.

     % myprog | dplot setup -i

     Pipe the output of myprog into dplot.  dplot will  read  the
     file _s_e_t_u_p and then take input (until EOF) from the standard
     input (the piped output of myprog in this case).

     % dplot -T tplot.1 tplot.2 tplot.3

     All files after the -T are taken as (binary) save files.

     alias cnp 'dplot -T -d canon'

     This is functionally equivalent to the (old) cnp program.

COMMANDS/TEXT/DATA FILES
     dplot text files can be any format file.   They  are  parsed
     into  words  separated  by  white  space (space, tab, return
     characters).  dplot commands are signaled by a  word  begin-
     ning with the command marker character (default: $).  It may
     have an argument.  Numbers (data) to be plotted are  thought
     to  be  in  columns.  Column counting is done by white space
     separated words but only  numeric  _w_o_r_d_s  are  used  in  the
     counting. Comments may be embedded within dplot files with a

     pound character (pound: #).  Text between the pound  charac-
     ter  and  the end of line is ignored.  Data and commands can
     be intermixed with one or more files.

COMMANDS
     dplot command summary.  These commands are  input  to  dplot
     through  files  (with or without data) or the standard input
     or the command line macros.

     Some commands take sub-commands  given  as  _c_o_m_m_a_n_d._s_u_b  and
     some can take an argument and some take both.  Arguments are
     either numeric or character (as in file  names).   Character
     type arguments should be quoted with either single or double
     quotes (and embedded quote  characters  may  be  escaped  by
     preceding  them with a backslash character).  If the charac-
     ter argument is only one word long, it need not  be  quoted.
     In  the following descriptions the use of a sub-command will
     be indicated as $_c_o_m_m_a_n_d._S and that of an argument  will  be
     either $_c_o_m_m_a_n_d _n_u_m or $_c_o_m_m_a_n_d _s_t_r.  Where sub-commands are
     _x  or  _y  the  sub-command  may  be  omitted  and  both  the
     corresponding X and Y values are set to the given argument.

     $dump
          Show current  dplot  settings.   There  is  an  option:
          $dump.to  _f_i_l_e where the current settings are dumped to
          the file _f_i_l_e in a form re-readable by dplot.

COMMANDS: NUMERIC ARGUMENTS
     $addto.S num
          Set data offset values (these values get added to  each
          datum _S = {_x,_y}

     $axsize.S num
          Hack command to override default axis label sizes.  _S =
          {_t_i_t_l_e,_l_a_b_e_l}

     $clip.S.SS [num]
          Set clip values for  plotting.   These  values  are  in
          inches  (for  now,  soon it can be inches on logical or
          physical axis or at some data values).  _S = {_h_i_g_h, _l_o_w}
          and  _S_S = {_x,_y}.  There are a couple of different forms
          of this command best illustrated by example:
          $clip.high.x 6.5 Set high clipping on  x  axis  at  6.5
          inches.
          $clip.high   6.5 Set x and y high clips at 6.5in.
          $clip.high No number given. Set high clipping  at  axis
          locations.

     $col.S num
          Set column number for X and Y. _S = {_x, _y}

     $label.loc.S num

DPLOT(1L)         UNKNOWN SECTION OF THE MANUAL         DPLOT(1L)



          Set the locators for label drawing.  This  affects  the
          commands  $symb.label,  $line.label, and $label.  These
          values can also be set (on devices with the capability)
          with  the  $locate  command.   _S = {_x, _y} Note that the
          value by default is relative to the screen, but can  be
          changed  to data relative with the $label.loc.data com-
          mand.

     $label.size N
          Set  the  size  of  label  strings  used  with  $label,
          $line.label and $symb.label.

     $line num
          Set the line type with which to plot. Note:  some  plot
          devices may have no line types.

     $locate num
          See $locate in the `action' commands below.

     $max.S num
          Set the maximum values to be plotted.  _S = {_x, _y}

     $min.S num
          Set the minimum values to be plotted.  _S = {_x, _y}

     $mulby.S num
          Set data scale values (each  datum  gets  multipled  by
          these values _S = {_x,_y}

     $ncols num
          Set the number of columns of data in the input.

     $offset.S num
          Set the origin offset to _n_u_m.  _S = {_x, _y}

     $pen.S num
          Set pen width for drawing.  There are three  pens,  one
          for data, one for axes and one for symbols and strings.
          _S = {_d_a_t_a, _a_x_i_s, _s_y_m_b}

     $rotate.S num
          Set the rotation angle and point about  which  rotation
          is to take place.  _S = {_x, _y, _a_n_g_l_e}

     $scale.S num
          Set the scale factor for each direction.  _S = {_x, _y}

     $segment.S num
          Select a segment (G_MARK'ed section of gplot2()  calls)
          to  be deleted on replay of save files ($gplot commands
          or $tplot files). If there is no subcommand  or  it  is
          _d_e_l,  then  set  _n_u_m  to  be  a  segment  to be deleted

          (gplot2() subcommands are segment/G_MARK numbers).   If
          the  subcommand  is  _k_e_e_p then the segment will be kept
          (remove it from the to-be-deleted list).  Additionally,
          with  no  numeric  parameter, the sub-command _s_h_o_w will
          print  the  current  to-be-deleted  list   of   segment
          numbers.  Likewise, the sub-command _r_e_s_e_t will keep all
          segments (reset the list to empty).   _S  =  {  -_e_m_p_t_y-,
          _d_e_l, _k_e_e_p, _s_h_o_w, _r_e_s_e_t }

     $symb.S num
          Set the symbol to be plotted at each point if  plotting
          by symbol.  _S = {_s_i_z_e} or omitted. If S is omitted, set
          symbol to symbol _n_u_m.  Symbols are numbered from  0  to
          15.  If S is _s_i_z_e change the default symbol size.

COMMANDS: ACTION OR SET-LOGICAL-FLAG
     $abs.S.SS
          Plot only the absolute values of data. To turn on: $abs
          or $abs.on will plot the absolute value of both X and Y
          values. To turn both off $abs.off.  To affect the abso-
          lute  value of just X or Y, try $abs.x or $abs.x.on and
          $abs.x.off (and $abs.y or $abs.y.on and $abs.y.off).

     $axis
          Draw the appropriate axis (Given: min, max, linear/log,
          labels).

     $axis.box
          Draw a simple box for the axis (ie: without  tic  marks
          and tic labels).

     $by.S
          Plot 'by' _S = {_l_i_n_e, _s_y_m_b,  _b_o_t_h}.   Do  plotting  with
          symbols, lines or both.

     $clear
          Clear the plot ``_s_c_r_e_e_n''.

     $label.loc.SS
          Set  the  mode  for  $label.loc.{x,y}   commands.    If
          SS=screen  (the  default),  label  locations are screen
          relative.  If SS=data then the values will  be  assumed
          to be data relative.

     $linear.S
          Set plot type to linear scale (this is the default).  _S
          = {_x, _y}

     $locate
          Use the tablet (assuming one is available) to  get  the
          current  {_x,_y}  position  instead  of using $label.loc.
          Thus, any $symb.label,$line.label, or  $label  commands

          will  draw at the _l_o_c_a_t_e_d point. (NOTE: if this command
          has a numeric operand, it will be passed  to  to  gplot
          call as the subcommand.  This is included since in some
          Plotcap definitions, the type of tablet  is  determined
          with the gplot subcommand.)

     $log.S
          Set plot type to logarithmic. _S = {_x, _y}

     $pen.S
          Raise or lower the drawing pen explicitly.   _S  =  {_u_p,
          _d_o_w_n}  The  pen  is  automatically  raised when $ncols,
          $col.x, $col.y change or when a new data file is begun.
          It  is sometimes, however, nice to be able to alter the
          default action.

     $reset.S
          Reset  internal  variables  to  the  original   default
          values.   The  $reset.cols  command  can be used to re-
          synchronize column counting for data items.

COMMANDS: STRING ARGUMENTS
     $asave str
          Simultaneously plot to current device and save all plot
          commands to a file.  Saving can be paused and restarted
          as well as stopped at any time. The auto-save  commands
          would look like:
          $asave savefile.gp      # turn saving on to new file.
          $asave.off      # don't save, file still open.
          $asave.on      # save again, to (still) open file.
          $asave.stop      # stop saving, close file.
          Note that the command $asave.file  savefile.gp  is  the
          same  as  $asave  savefile.gp and that only these forms
          take a parameter (a file name).

     $axplt2 str
          Call the high2 library function axplt2 directly.   This
          was added as a quick hack for someone and has been left
          in since it may be the  only  way  to  accomplish  some
          tasks.   The string is a comma separated list of axplt2
          arguments.  See the high2 manual.

     $cd str
          Or $_c_h_d_i_r _s_t_r can be  used  (on  systems  that  support
          directory  trees)  to  change  the working directory to
          which dplot is connected.  Note that not  all  versions
          support  this command (but those that don't are on sys-
          tems where the command has no meaning).

     $device str
          (or dev).  Set plot device to that named _s_t_r.

     $echo.s str
          Echo the given string to the standard output.   _s_t_r  is
          optional.   If  the sub-command is nl then echo without
          added a newline. ($echo.nl "hi")

     $file str
          Take commands and/or data from the file named _s_t_r.

     $gpget str
          Call the gpgeti() routine directly.  Prints the  infor-
          mation returned.  Useful for debugging but probably not
          much else. Example: $gpget G_PSIZE

     $gplot str
          Call gplot2() directly.  String is  a  comma  separated
          list  of gplot arguments (see gplot2 for details).  The
          gplot commands can be numeric or symbolic.   For  exam-
          ple:  $gplot "G_MOVE,,2,3.45" or $gplot "gmove,,2,3.45"
          or $gplot 3,0,2,3.45 are all equivalent.  Note  that  a
          null  parameter  is  set to zero.  The names are mapped
          from the system gplot include or the file specified  by
          the  GPLOTH  environment variable.  This was originally
          added  for debugging, but has proved  useful  for  many
          other  needs.   Note  the  case is unimportant and that
          underscore characters are optional.

     $label.S str
          Set the label for each axis to _s_t_r.  _S = {_x, _y} If _S is
          not  given  then  draw  the string at the current label
          locations. (See the command $label.loc num in the  Com-
          mands with numeric values section).

     $line.label str
          Draw a small line segment in the current line  type  at
          the  current  label  location (See $label.loc num) fol-
          lowed by the given string.

     $outfile str
          Set the output file to _s_t_r.  All plot  output  will  be
          put in this file.

     $symb.label str
          Draw the current symbol at the current  label  location
          (See $label.loc num) followed by the given string.

     $sys str
          Execute the system command _s_t_r in a sub-shell.  This is
          a  shell  escape.  Note that like titles, etc. if there
          are embedded white spaces, the string must be quoted.
          NOTE: there is a special form of the $sys commands.  As
          with  most  Unix  commands,  an exclamation mark in the
          first column is taken as a shell escape.  But  in  this

          case  no quoting (other than that required by the shell
          being used) is required; the remainder of the  line  up
          to  a  newline is take as the shell command to execute.
          Likewise, if the first character is  the  shell  escape
          and the second character is a less than symbol (<) then
          the entire line is taken as a shell command to  execute
          and  (like  _s_y_s._i_n)  the  output  from  the  command is
          trapped by dplot and used as input at that point.

     $sys.in str
          Like the sys command, but all output from  the  command
          is _c_a_u_g_h_t by dplot and taken as further input. See note
          for sys.

     $title str
          Set the title of the plot to _s_t_r.  NOTE: if  the  title
          has  embedded  spaces,  it  must be quoted (with either
          single or double quotes).

     $tplot str
          Take _s_t_r to be a tplot file and re-draw the plot.  (See
          the -_t option).

     $tty Take input from the user's terminal at this point until
          a control-D is reached.

COMMANDS: SOME EXTRA COMMANDS (MISC.)
     There are now some _e_x_t_r_a commands that allow a  little  more
     fooling  around with the final plot.  These are like regular
     dplot commands, except that they have an extra  sub-command,
     as $extra.command.sub arg.

     $phys.c.s arg
          This command can be used to alter the physical  set  up
          of the plot axis.  Note that in some cases the argument
          can be a percentage. This should be given as  a  number
          between  0  and  100  immediately followed by a percent
          sign.  Thus to specify that the origin  of  the  X-axis
          should be at 10 percent of the screen:
               $phys.origin.x 10%
     Note also that giving .10 would mean 1/10th of a  plot  unit
     (inch).

          $phys.origin.S val
               Set the origin of the axis  to  the  given  value.
               Value  can either be some absolute value or a per-
               centage of full screen size. S = x,y and if  omit-
               ted, both X and Y are set.

          $phys.len.S val
               Set the length  of each axis to the  given  value.
               Again  the  same  holds for percentages and x or y

               being omitted.

          $phys.max.S val
               Regardless of the settings for origin and  length,
               the right side (for _x) and/or the top side (for _y)
               are not to be greater than _v_a_l (in  plot  units  -
               inches).

          $phys.aspect.S val
               Set the aspect ratio for  the  axis.   Within  the
               above  constraints, make the largest plot possible
               with the given ratio in length of sides.  For _S  =
               x,  x/y or omitted, _v_a_l is taken as the ratio of X
               to Y. For _S = y , y/x the value is  taken  as  the
               ratio of Y to X.

STARTUP FILES
     When dplot starts up it will search for a file  of  commands
     to execute before anything else.  The file can be in several
     places, the first one found will be the one  executed.   The
     first  file  tried  is the value of the environment variable
     DPLOTRC.  If this variable is not set or the named  file  is
     not  readable,  it will try the file .dplotrc in the current
     directory.  If this is non-existent  or  is  unreadable,  it
     will try the file .dplotrc in the users home directory.  The
     start up file may contain any dplot commands or comments  or
     whatever.

FILES
     $DPLOTRC - User specifiable startup file name.
     ./.dplotrc - Next choice for a startup file.
     $HOME/.dplotrc - And the next choice for a startup file  for
     dplot.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
     DPLOTRC - User specifiable startup file name.
     DEFPDEV - Default plot device if none given.
     DEFPFIL - Default output file if none given.
     PLOTCAP - Alternate plotcap file.
     GPLOTH - Location  of  the  gplot  definitions  file  (often
     "/usr/include/local/gplot.h")  other than the default.  This
     is only used with symbolic constants with  the  $gplot  com-
     mand.  TERM - Default plot device if DEFPDEV not given.
     HOME - Home directory to in which to find start up file.
     LOGDIR - Used for home directory if HOME is not set  (System
     V systems).
     SHELL - Shell to use for shell escapes (sys commands).

DIAGNOSTICS
     Errors are reported giving input file and  line  number  and
     maybe  some  added  information.  Numbers in parenthesis are
     error returns from a specific internal subroutine.

DPLOT(1L)         UNKNOWN SECTION OF THE MANUAL         DPLOT(1L)



NOTES
     dplot now sets plot sizes by default to some  percentage  of
     the screen (plot device) size.  It also does not clip on the
     axis bounds (as one might expect).  Thus, you  may  want  to
     create  a  .dplotrc  file  in you home directory and add the
     following lines to emulate the way dplot used to start up:

          $phys.origin.x 1.25
          $phys.origin.y  .75
          $phys.len.x   8.0
          $phys.len.y   4.0
          $clip.high
