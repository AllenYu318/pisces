NAME
     digit - digitize input from tablet

SYNOPSIS
     digit [option switches]

DESCRIPTION
     _D_i_g_i_t will digitize points from the tablet (_u_s_u_a_l_l_y _t_h_e_r_e
     _w_i_l_l _b_e _a _g_r_a_p_h _o_n _t_h_e _t_a_b_l_e_t).  The coordinates of each
     point are put into an output file with the _x coordinate in
     the first column and the _y coordinate in the second column.

     If the user is in _i_n_t_e_r_a_c_t_i_v_e mode, the program will give
     the user a command prompt, digit>.  Otherwise, the program
     will first do a setup procedure which will ask the user to
     enter three different points on the axes.  For the program
     to work properly one point must be on the _o_r_i_g_i_n, one on the
     end of the _x axis, and one on the end _y axis.  The program
     will only accept axes which are orthogonal.  If the axes are
     not within a few degrees from being orthogonal, the user
     will be asked to reenter the points.  Then the program will
     make sure that the scales for _x and _y have been entered.
     The user will be prompted for any information it needs.  The
     program will initialize by rescaling the plotting device to
     match the graph. Then it will take points entered from the
     plotting device and put the coordinates into an output file,
     and it will exit the program.

OPTION-SWITCHES
     -command [value]
               Any of the commands in digit can be used as option
               switches.  If the command does not require that a
               _v_a_l_u_e be given then the program will not expect to
               find one.

     -i        The program will go into an interactive mode after
               all of the switches have been evaluated.  The
               default is to digitize and then exit the program.
               This switch is useful if you are going to digitize
               more than one graph.


     NOTE: switches are processed in the order in which they are
     entered

COMMANDS
     digitize  This command will cause the program to automati-
               cally lead the user through the program and will
               ask the user for any information that it needs.
               No other commands should be necessary.  However,
               if the user enters values for some or all of the
               variables then the program will run faster because

               it won't need to ask the user for those values.

     device plot-device (or) d plot-device
               The plotting device will be set to be _p_l_o_t-_d_e_v_i_c_e.

     min.x  value
               This sets the _m_i_n_i_m_u_m value of _x to be equal to
               _v_a_l_u_e.

     max.x value
               This sets the _m_a_x_i_m_u_m value of _x to be equal to
               _v_a_l_u_e.

     min.y  value
               This sets the _m_i_n_i_m_u_m value of _y to be equal to
               _v_a_l_u_e.

     max.y value
               This sets the _m_a_x_i_m_u_m value of _y to be equal to
               _v_a_l_u_e.

     log.x     This tells the program that all _x values are
               scaled logarithmically on the graph.

     log.y     This tells the program that all _y values are
               scaled logarithmically on the graph.

     lin.x     This tells the program that _x values are scaled
               linearly on the graph.  This is the default.

     lin.y     This tells the program that _y values are scaled
               linearly on the graph.  This is the default.

     write filename (or) o filename
               The file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e will be rewritten or is created
               so that the data points can be put into it.

     append filename
               The file _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e will be opened in append mode.

     file [filename]
               The program will digitize points entered from the
               tablet.  The output will be written into _f_i_l_e_n_a_m_e.

     setup     This calls a procedure which will initalize the
               program so that it will be able to properly con-
               vert the input from the tablet.

     show      The value for each variable will be printed onto
               the terminal screen.

     verbose (or) v

               Toggles between verbose and no verbose modes.  In
               verbose mode the program will print the coordi-
               nates of each point that was entered from the
               tablet and will tell the user the total number of
               points that were entered.

     graph (or) g
               Toggles between graph and no graph modes.  In
               graph mode the program will automatically plot the
               input onto to screen after all of the data points
               have been entered.

     quit      Terminates the program.

EXAMPLES
     The following line of commands will open _t_e_s_t._o_u_t, set the
     maximum and minimum values of both x and y, set the plotting
     device to be _t_e_k_c_t, and will cause the program to automati-
     cally digitize after all of the switches on the command line
     have been evaluated.

          % digit -o test.out -min.x 0 -max.x 0.44 -min.y 1e17
           -max.y 1e19 -log.y -d tekct

     or to do the same thing without using switches the user
     would type

          % digit -i
          digit> write test.out
          digit> min.x 0
          digit> max.x .44
          digit> min.y 1e17
          digit> max.y 1e19
          digit> log.y
          digit> d tekct
          digit> digitize
          digit> quit

     or the user could simply type

          % digit

     and the user will be prompted for all of the other necessary
     information.

BUGS
     The program cannot digitize graphs that are in polar coordi-
     nates.
