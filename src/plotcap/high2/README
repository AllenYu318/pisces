	*** HIGH2 higher level (2d) library code. ***

 The function symbl2() has an include file that describes the "drawn-font".
 The character descriptions were compiled from the symb2.defs file.  This
 file can be modified and re-made with the program mksym.  The distributed
 Makefile has be modified to not re-make symb2.h if symb2.defs changes,
 but can be remodified back by removing the comment before each line
 between #%TMP and #%end.  The file example.defs is similar but contains
 some ``fun'' defs (some Japanese kanji, for example).  Read the header
 in the source for mksym.
