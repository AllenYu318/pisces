c "p1data": Plot the given data arrays.
c
c Calling Sequence:
c	call P1DATA(x, y, nxy, xlog, ylog, bylin, bysym)
c
c Where:
c	x	- real array.  Values to plot along the X-axis.
c	y	- real array.  Values to plot along the Y-axis.
c	nxy	- integer.  Number of points in X,Y
c	xlog	- integer.  1::Take the log of each X-value before
c                 plotting.
c	ylog	- integer.  1::Take the log of each Y-value before
c                 plotting.
c	bylin	- If >= 1 then connect each point with a line of
c		  type 'bylin'.  If == 0 then don't connect points.
c	bysym	- If >= 1 then put symbol 'bysym' at each point.
