	*** src/plot/tool/ ***

 This directory contains source for plot window ``tools''.  There is a tool
 plotcap entry which gplot can use to send commands that these tools will
 understand.  The connection to the tool is through a pipe.  Other
 mechanisms could be used, but this is built into gplot and all flavors
 of Unix.

 The file "tool.c" is the main for each of the tools.  It reads the
 plotcap commands from the pipe, decodes them and then calls a few
 functions to actually do the work.  These functions need to be written
 for the specific window manager.  Commands may be ignored, but it should
 at least be able to move, draw, clear, init, pend.

 Currently, there are tools for 
	sunview	-- Suns with the notifier.  This has a bug in that it ignores
		   the first several vectors.  I have put write statements
		   is the sun code (to a log file) and it is getting the
		   calls, but there is no displaying of the vectors.
		   Got me!
		   [ Files: sunview_lib.c, sunview.icon ]
	x	-- For the X window system.  Seems to work pretty well, even
		   returns cursor location G_CLOC. It even does color
		   and area fills.
		   [ Files: x_lib.c, x.curs (3 cursors), the X icon is
		   created from the sunview.icon by the program sun2x.c ]

 Others should be simple to write.  Any new tools or fixes to these --
 let me know and they can be merged into the next release.

 These tools only need to be built for systems that will support them.
 They are not required to make the plot library work.
