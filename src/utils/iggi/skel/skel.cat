DESCRIPTION
     Skel is an interactive grid  editor.  It  generates  outline
     files which can be read and triangulated by tri(1). The out-
     put of tri can be used as the initial grid in  PISCES-II  or
     SUPREM-IV.

     -a   ("Axis") Turns off drawing axes.

     -s   ("Short") Make all messages short. Speeds up  the  menu
          display.

     files
          Files to be edited.

BUGS
     Regions must be simply connected (no holes)
     Some commands do not fix the screen if they abort early.
     Graphics input must not be typed ahead.
     When moving a block or a region around, the  error  checking
     can  get  obstreperous.  There is a secret option (-n) which
     turns checking off.
