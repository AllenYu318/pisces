DESCRIPTION
     Tri generates the grid for two-dimensional  simulators.   It
     reads  a  'skeleton'  of  the structure from the input file,
     which may be generated with  a  text  editor  or  using  the
     interface  skel(1).   Depending  on  a  number  of numerical
     parameters, triangular grid is generated to cover the skele-
     ton,  and  by  default some smoothing is done to improve the
     triangles. The output is then written to a file of the  same
     type  as  the  input. An output file in PISCES-II format can
     also be generated.

     -Cstring
          ("Command") The string following C is a command to  the
          smoothing  phase.  There  are  three types of smoothing
          available, averaging, flipping, and nonlinear optimiza-
          tion.   The command string is a sequence of the letters
          'a','f','o' giving the smoothing steps to perform.  The
          default  command  string is Cfa, which performs a flip-
          ping step and an averaging step in that order. Flipping
          and  averaging  steps  are  quite  fast (~1 min for 600
          nodes). Optimization steps are slow (~15  min  for  600
          nodes),  but  usually  do a good job of removing obtuse
          triangles. Optimization can be completely turned off by
          putting nothing after the -C.

     -D   ("Debug") Turn on cryptic debugging information.

     -c   ("CPU") Save CPU time of optimizer in the file opt.cpu.

     -d   ("Display") The triangulation is plotted as it is  gen-
          erated. Default off.

     -i <number>
          ("Inner") Set the convergence tolerance  of  the  inner
          loop, default 1%.

TRI()             UNKNOWN SECTION OF THE MANUAL             TRI()



     -l <number>
          ("Limit") Limit the number of outer loops in the optim-
          izer, default 15.

     -n   ("No Edge Division")  Do not split  edges.   Just  tri-
          angulate.

     -o   ("Output") Defines the  output  file;  the  default  is
          t.out.

     -p   ("Pisces") Requests a file formatted for PISCES-II.

     -q <number>
          ("Quality") Set the minimum quality of  triangles  gen-
          erated,  on  a scale of 0 to 1.  This is a guideline to
          how fussy the program should be; the less,  the  faster
          it  runs,  but  the worse the angles generated. Default
          0.6.

     -r <number>
          Defines  the  maximum  ratio  between  adjacent  edges,
          default  1.5,  normal range is 1.1 - 2.  Decreasing the
          ratio creates better  triangles  but  more  nodes,  and
          increasing it does the opposite.

     -s   ("Summary") Prints a short description of the mesh gen-
          erated. Default off.

     -t <number>
          Set the convergence tolerance of the optimizer, default
          1% (which amounts to 18o9 of error in the angles).

BUGS
     Generates obtuse triangles.
     Regions must be simply connected (no holes)
