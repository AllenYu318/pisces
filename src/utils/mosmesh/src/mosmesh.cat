NAME
     mosmesh - Pisces deck generator for  simple  MOS  devices  -
     Version 8822

SYNOPSIS
     mosmesh [ -abist -f [defaultfile] -m[modifyfile] -o [output-
     file]  ] [ outputfile ]

DESCRIPTION
     _M_O_S_M_E_S_H is an interactive program that generates a PISCES2-B
     input  deck MOS structures.  Questions are asked of the user
     such  as  doping  concentrations,   gate   lengths,   spacer
     thicknesses,  and  range of biases applied to the terminals.
     Upon completion, a pisces deck is generated in file  output-
     file.

OPTIONS
     -a   Use analytic functions for doping profiles [default].

     -b   Batch mode.  take default data and generate a deck.

     -f [defaultfile]
          read default information from file defaultfile.  if  no
          filename is given then the default is .defaultmesh.

     -i   Generate drain characteristics.

     -m [modifyfile]
          indicates that the default values to change (along with
          their new values) are present in file modifyfile.

     -o [filename]
          write output to filename.  if no filename is given then
          the  default  is  mosmesh.out.   also  if a filename is
          given as the last argument to mosmesh, then the -o flag
          is ignored.

     -s   indicates that Suprem3 doping profiles will be used

     -t   Generate gate characteristics for a fixed drain bias.

EXAMPLE
          1 zotz> mosmesh -i filea - generates Pisces deck for
                         drain characteristics in filea

          2 zotz> mosmesh -t fileb - generates Pisces deck for
                         gate characteristics in fileb

          3 zotz> mosmesh -f playmesh -o outfile - generates Pisces deck
                         from information in playmesh and writes the
                         deck to outfile. no solve cards are present.

MOSMESH(1)                USER COMMANDS                MOSMESH(1)



          4 zotz> mosmesh -st gate.in - use Suprem3 doping files and generate
                            gate characteristics in gate.in

          5 zotz> mosmesh -m changes -b -o outfile - operates in batch mode,
                                     using the defaults in .defaultmesh.
                                     In addition any changes to the
                                     default values are specified in file
                                     changes.  See user manual for
                                     details.

FILES
     .defaultmesh holds responses from previous mosmesh run

     .tempfile holds data from current session


BUGS
     does not check input for unreasonable data

     no backup mode to change a previous entry.  you  must  rerun
     the program.

     convergence problems with very short channel devices.

     please report any other bugs to chin@rats.stanford.edu
