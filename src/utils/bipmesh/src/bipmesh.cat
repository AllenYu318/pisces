NAME
     bipmesh - Pisces deck generator for  simple  MOS  devices  -
     Version 8908

SYNOPSIS
     bipmesh [ -abs -f [defaultfile] -m[modifyfile]  -o  [output-
     file]  ] [ outputfile ]

DESCRIPTION
     _B_I_P_M_E_S_H is an interactive program that generates a PISCES2-B
     input  deck  for bipolar structures.  Questions are asked of
     the user such as doping concentrations  and  lateral  dimen-
     sion.   Upon  completion, a pisces deck is generated in file
     outputfile.

OPTIONS
     -a   Use analytic functions for doping profiles [default].

     -b   Batch mode.  take default data and generate a deck.

     -c   indicates that both Suprem3 and  analytic  doping  pro-
          files will be used

     -f [defaultfile]
          read default information from file defaultfile.  if  no
          filename is given then the default is .defaultmesh.

     -m [modifyfile]
          indicates that the default values to change (along with
          their new values) are present in file modifyfile.

     -o [filename]
          write output to filename.  if no filename is given then
          the  default  is  mosmesh.out.   also  if a filename is
          given as the last argument to mosmesh, then the -o flag
          is ignored.

     -s   indicates that Suprem3 doping profiles will be used

EXAMPLE
          1 zotz> mosmesh -f playmesh -o outfile - generates Pisces deck from information
                                            in playmesh and writes the deck to outfile.

          2 zotz> mosmesh -s bip.in - use Suprem3 doping files and creates a pisces deck bip.in.

          3 zotz> mosmesh -m changes -b -o outfile - operates in batch mode, using the defaults
                                             in .defaultmesh.  In addition any changes to the
                                             default values are specified in file changes.

FILES
     .defaultmesh holds responses from previous mosmesh run
