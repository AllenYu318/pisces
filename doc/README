This is the directory in which the sources for PISCES documentation
are kept.  If you have access to a postscript-compatible printer,
two important documents can be printed immediately:

cards/paper-tr  --  The updated command summary for PISCES.
notes/tfldmob.ps -- Notes on the use of the new transverse-field
		    mobility model.

The Troff sources for all files are also available, including
those for the PISCES IIB Supplementary Report in the manual 
directory.
