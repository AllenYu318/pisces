		SIMPLE NMOS DEVICE EXAMPLE

This example is a simulation of a NMOS device.  The device consists of
n=type source and drain diffusions with concentration of 1e18.  The source
and drain diffusions have Gaussian profiles.  The substrate is doped p-type
with a uniform concentration of 1e16.  The device dimensions are 3 micron
by 3 micron.


The nmos.p2 file generates the mesh and defines the device.  The grid is 
first generated and the using the eliminate cards, unnecessary grid points
are removed.  The region statements are used to designate the oxide and
silicon regions.  The device is then equiped with four electrodes for 
gate, drain, source, and substrate.  The mesh is written to a file called 
nmesh.  The grid, junctions, and doping curves are then plotted. 


The mosIV.p2 simulates the gate and drain characteristics of the device 
defined by nmos.p2.  An initial solution is obtained at 0V bias condition.
To generate the gate characteristics, the drain is biased at a low potential
of 0.1V, while the source is grounded.  The gate voltage is stepped in 
0.1V steps until Vgs is 1.5V.  The gate characteristic is then plotted.
To obtain the drain characteristic, the gate is biased at 2V and the source 
is grounded.  The drain voltage is then stepped in 0.1V steps until the 
drain reaches 2 volts.  The drain characteristic is then plotted.
