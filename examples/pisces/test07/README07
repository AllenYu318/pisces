			A PMOS DEVICE

This is an example of a pmos device which also reads in the impurity 
doping profile.  

A file called mesh098.p2 is used to define the device.  This file first
specifies the mesh and then eliminates the undesired points in the  
substrate.  The oxide and silicon regions are then specified and the
necessary electrodes are provided.  The doping like the previous nmos example
is provided by the file called depthcon except this file contains 
concentration that is negative in value since this is a pmos device.
The doping profile generates an ascii outfile called DOP232.  Similar to
the previous example, the interface charge, the gate contact, the surface
mobility, and the models are defined.  The relevant doping profiles and
the junctions of the device are plotted.

Similar to the nmos example, the gate characteristics is solved for next.
The file that generates this curve is called idvg098.p2.  It reads in the
mesh file, defines the surface mobility, the gate contact, the appropriate
models and the interface charge.  Both the intial solution and the gate
characteristics are solved using a single carrier newton method.  LOG098P is a llog file used to save the simulation data.

Please note that since this is a pmos device, its the holes one solves for in
the symbolic card.  The drain is biased at -.05 volts while the gate voltage
is varied from -0.1 to -5.0 volts.  Outfiles are saved at -1,-2,-3,-4 and
-5 volts.  The drain current versus the gate voltage is then plotted.
