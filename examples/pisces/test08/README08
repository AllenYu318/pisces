			SCHOTTKY DIODE

This simulation is a very simple example of the schottky diode.  The 
junction consists of a p-type region with a concentration of 5e19 and
a metal contact with a work function difference of 0.8 eV.  The device
measures 1 x 1 micron, and a very simple mesh is used to grid this small
area.  The mesh is saved in a file called shot.msh.  The intial solution
is obtained using a two carrier gummel method.  To solve for the forward
characteristics, a two carrier newton method is used.  Forward characteristics
are solved for by grounding the contact and by forward biasing the 
junction by applying a positive voltage to the p region.  The simulation
results are stored in a log file called shotIV.log.  

This example also tests for the charge conservation pertaining to the 
two contacts.  Charge extraction is basically integration of charge on
the metal contact.  This should show charge neutrality in the absence
of applied bias.   This is done by a file called schot.p2.
