			A SOI MOSFET

The two previous examples lead up to this final version of the 1.5 micron soi 
(silicon-on-insulator) mosfet.  The grid is generated by a file called
soigrid.p2.  The grid, the elimination of the undesired points and the
distortion of the grid are similar to the previous examples.  The regions
define the gate oxide on top, followed by the active silicon area, with
the insulating oxide underneath it which is on top of the the silicon
substrate.  The silicon regions are uniformly doped p-type to 1e15 with the
source and drain regions being n-type with the concentration of 2e19.  This
file also plots the grid, junction and the doping contours.

Next step is to solve for the gate characteristics.  This is done by a file
called soisolv.p2.  This file reads in the mesh and then uses a single 
carrier gummel method to find the initial solution at zero bias.  The intial
solution is stored in a file called soi.init.  The gate characteristics are
solved for using a single carrier newton method.  A log file is started 
to save the simulation data.  The drain is biased at 0.1 volts and an
outfile is saved called soibias.1.  The gate is varied from -0.5 volts
to 2.0 volts.  The gate characteristic is then plotted.
