This is a simple example of how to use skel and tri.


1)  To use skel just type the command

bbc:conor > ../skel/skel

You'll get a menu on the left hand margin.


2)  Click the Create button.  You'll see a submenu to the right.

3)  Click the Node button since you need to enter points for your
	struture.

4)  At the top of the grid you see the words "Where".  This is your
	cue to click at a point inside the axis area.  When you have
	clicked the point, you'll see the "Where" prompt again asking
	you for another point.  When you are done click a point
	outside the axis area. The "Where" prompt will go away.

5)  Click Region button in the Create submenu.  The prompt will change to
	"Node".  This is your signal to point at the nodes created in
	step 4.  Note that as you select points, segments are drawn
	to connect the first point with the current point and the
	current point to the previous point(these will be triangles).
	When you have selected all of the points, click outside the
	axis area.

6)  Click Quit button in the Create submenu.  This brings you back to
	the main menu.

7)  Click File button.  You'll see a submenu to the right.

8)  Click Write button.  In the window which you invoked skel, you'll
	be asked for a filename.  Use skel.demo.

9)  Click Quit button in the File submenu.  This brings you back to
	the main menu.

10) Click Quit button.  You'll see a submenu to the right.

11) Click Yes button.  You've finished using tri and now you can
	use tri.

12)  To triangulate the region use the command

bbc:conor > ../tri/tri skel.demo -o tri.demo

13)  If you are creating input for pisces use the command

bbc:conor > ../tri/tri skel.demo -p tri.pisces
