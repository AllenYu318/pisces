PISCES and the included utilities have all been compiled.  The 
graphical viewing facilities which are part of plotcap have not been 
tested.

This software is written in both C and Fortran, and it is likely that 
parameter mismatches in their interfaces may cause the program to 
crash.  Please report these issues on our site:

There is currently not a test suite that is part of the build system, 
but this is a work in progress.
